<c "#ffff00"> 2.4.1 Auto-attack </c>
<br><br>
The auto-attack feature is nice, especially for those who will be using melee combat extensively. The default key for auto-attack is the <c "#66CCFF">[ Q ]</c> key. When you press it, your character will begin to attack your current target, if it is in melee range.<br>
<br>
<c "#66CCFF">** NOTE:</c> You may chose to change some of the default keymap settings to be something a little more to your preference. To do this, first press ALT+O, and then select the tab at the top of the new window that is marked "Keyboard".</c><br>
