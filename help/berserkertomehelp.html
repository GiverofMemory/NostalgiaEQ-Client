&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; placed on your mouse cursor.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Move your cursor with the tome still on it over to your guildmaster<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; window.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bottom of the window. You should see a <c "#66FF00">"Make Hotkey"</c> button.<br>
