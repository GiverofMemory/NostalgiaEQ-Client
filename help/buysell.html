<c "#ffff00"> 2.5.1 Acquiring, Selling, and Buying Items </c>
<br><br>
The most common method of acquiring items is to defeat monsters in battle and looting their corpse. It is important to note that you can only loot an NPC corpse if the damage you and your group did to that NPC was greater then anyone else or their group. It is considered good etiquette not to interfere in combat unless asked.<br>
<br>
To loot the corpse of a monster you have killed, right-click on the corpse to open its inventory, then right click on the items that you wish to keep. To buy or sell to a merchant, right-click on the merchant while standing relatively close to him. Click on an item in your inventory to offer to sell it, or click on an item in the merchant's inventory to offer to buy it. Press the buy or sell button, depending on what you want to do. If it is a stackable item, you will be asked how many of the stack you wish to buy or sell. Use the arrows to select the quantity you wish to buy or sell, or click in the quantity box and type in the number.<br>
