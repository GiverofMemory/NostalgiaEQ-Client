<c "#ffff00"> 2.7 Exiting the Game </c>
<br><br>
When you are not playing, your character does not require food, drink, or rest. Your character's previous condition is restored the next time you start the game.  For example, if you were tired and hungry, you'll still be tired and hungry when you resume playing.<br>
<br>
To exit the game, sit down and set up camp in a safe area. Press <c "#66CCFF">[Sit]</c> on the main menu, then press <c "#66CCFF">[Camp]</c>. This process will take roughly 30 seconds for your character to leave the game completely. Press escape at the character select screen, and then again at the server select.<br>
<br>
When you return to the game later, your character will be where you left him, keep that in mind when choosing a campsite.<br>
<br>
<c "#66CCFF">** NOTE:</c> You may also use the following arguments with the <c "#B4B4B4">/camp</c> command, which allow you to either camp to the server select screen, or to desktop. These commands are <c "#B4B4B4">/camp server</c> and <c "#B4B4B4">/camp desktop</c>.<br>
