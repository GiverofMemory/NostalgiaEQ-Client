There are four map layers.  The Base layer contains any maps created by SOE.  The other three layers (1, 2 and 3) are for use by players to create their own maps or additions to the ones provided.
<br><br>
You can toggle any of these layers by clicking on the appropriate buttons under "Layers: Visible" heading.

When drawing maps, you can choose which of the three available layers you wish to draw on by selecting that layer under the Active heading.

<br><br>
