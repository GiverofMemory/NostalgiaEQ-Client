<br><br>
The compass is a very useful tool in exploring the game, as it will help you in learning the lay of the land. As you start out, the compass may not work very well. It may be very difficult to read, and even sometimes inaccurate. This is because your skill at determining your heading has not been refined quite yet.<br>
<br>
In order to use the sense heading skill, you will want to place it on an easily accessible hot key button. To do this, first click on the abilities tab on the main menu window. Right click on an empty hot button slot, and select sense heading from the list to assign to that button. Click on that hotbutton to use the skill.<br>
<br>
When you click on the hotbutton, you will receive a message on your screen either saying <c "#66CCFF">"You have no idea what direction you are facing."</c>, or <c "#66CCFF">"You think you are heading South."</c> This hotkey has a refresh timer of roughly 3 seconds, which means you are only able to use this skill once every three seconds.<br>
