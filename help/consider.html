<c "#ffff00"> 2.4.2 The "/Con" System </c>
<br><br>
The /Con system is a means for a player to consider the level of difficulty of his opponent. To consider something, right click on your target. You may also left-click on your target, then type <c "#B4B4B4">/con</c>, they both work identically. When you consider something, you will receive one of six colored messages back. Below is a listing of those colors and what they mean.<br>
<br>
<c "#007F00">* Green</c> - This target is significantly below your skill level.<br>
<br>
<c "#00F0F0">* Light Blue</c> - This target is significantly below your skill level.<br>
<br>
<c "#00007F">* Blue</c> - This target is an adequate challenge.<br>
<br>
* White - This target is of equivalent skill, and is a great challenge.<br>
<br>
<c "#ffff00">* Yellow</c> - This target is more skilled than you are.<br>
<br>
<c "#FF0000">* Red</c> - This target is far more skilled than you are.<br>
