<br><br>
If you are having technical problems with the game, (Lockups, Connection Issues, etc.), a GM will be unable to assist you. We do, however, provide several methods for contacting the Technical Support Staff. <br>
<br>
The following link will take you to our Technical Support Page on the EverQuest.com website. This page will allow you to search our online knowledgebase of information, give you troubleshooting tips, based on the type of problem you are having, as well as allowing you to chat live with our Customer Support Representatives. <br>
