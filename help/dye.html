<br><br>
To open the Armor Dye window, open your inventory <c "#66CCFF">[ I ]</c> and click on the <c "#66CCFF">Dye Button</c>.
<br><br>
To add a dye to a location, simply find the row that corresponds to that location in the window.  Then click on the box under the Armor Dye column.
<br><br>
This brings up the Choose a color window.  You can choose one of the pre-created colors, or you can create a color using the RGB values.  The currently chosen color will show in the box on the bottom left.  When you have the color you wish, click <c "#66CCFF">Accept</c>.
<br><br>
Each color change requires a reagent.  The total number of reagents needed to make all of your currently selected color changes is displayed at the bottom of the Armor Dye window.  You will be able to see the changes on your character as you make them.
<br><br>
Once you have chosen all of the dyes you wish to use, just click <c "#66CCFF">Save Dye</c> and the window will close and your changes will appear to those around you.
<br><br><br>
The box under the Item Tint column shows you any tint native to the piece of armor in that location at that time.  This tint will be ignored if a dye is used in that location, this information is just there for reference.
<br><br>
Armor dye is applied to the location, not to the specific item in that location, so any item placed in a dyed location will be affected by the dye.  Once the item is removed from that location, or if the dye is removed, it will return to its usual color.
<br><br>
To remove a dye, simply dye the location white.
<br><br>
<c "#66CCFF">** NOTE:</c>  Some items have a natural color.  For example, many leather items appear brown.  This color is inherent to the item and is not a tint; it will always be a part of the color of that armor.  This may cause some items to be affected by a dye differently than others.
