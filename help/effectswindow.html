<br><br>
Among the many different windows you will be presented with when you first log in to EverQuest you should see one with a translucent background that says "Effects" in the title bar. This is the window where all current spell effects on your character are placed. This includes any spell with a duration. Most commonly, these are what is referred to as "Buffs", or beneficial spells.  However, as you gain levels you will encounter monsters that will cast damaging spells on you that may reside in this box.<br>
<br>
<c "#66CCFF">** NOTE: </c> You are only able to have a total of 15 spells in this box at any given time.<br>
