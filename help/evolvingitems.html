<br><br>
Evolving Items are yet another way to advance your character as they improve/change over time as you use them!  To check if an item you own is Evolving, display the item (shift-left click is one way to do this) and see if there is an Evolving status line, telling you the item's current level and experience progress toward its next level.  There is also a link to view what the item will eventually become.
<br><br>
Evolving Items gain experience as you kill monsters in EverQuest.  This is bonus experience; there is no loss of regular player experience.  In order to gain experience, the Evolving Item must be worn and active.  To see which items you have and their status, use the tab in the Inventory window labeled "Evolving Items."  In this tab, you should see a list of your currently worn Evolving Items.  Use this list and the buttons below to change the active status of your Evolving Items.  Evolving Items also have a green or red background to their item icons in your inventory.  A green background means the item is active and will gain experience, a red icon means the opposite.  Note that Evolving Items are ineligible to receive experience during the first 30 seconds after they are worn.
<br><br>
Evolving Items gain levels just like a player.  When an item gains enough experience, it evolves with appropriate changes to its statistics, effects, etc.  You'll get a message every time an item evolves.  Note that some Evolving Items have required levels, and it's possible that an item may not be allowed to evolve if the item would no longer be usable by you at your current level.  If this happens, you'll get a message, and can turn off experience to that item (see above) until you achieve the appropriate level.
<br><br>
Some Evolving Items can transfer experience to each other.  In Corathus Creep there's a machine that will allow you to transfer experience from one Evolving Item to another.  Be careful, though, as sometimes this process allows only partial transfers or reduces the experience gained by the new item to some percentage of the old item's experience.
<br><br>
A subset of Evolving Items, called Intelligent Items, can talk to you and those around you.  There is a filter and a redirect option to place these dialogues into whichever chat window you like, or hide them altogether.
