<br><br>
When you first enter the world of Norrath, you start out at experience level 1 in whichever class you chose. The primary method of gaining experience is through combat; however, experience is also awarded for completing quests. If you wish to view your current level and how much experience you need to advance to the next level, open your inventory and look on the left side. The experience bar is located directly beneath the <c "#66CCFF">NEXT LEVEL</c> label. <br>
