<c "#ffff00"> 3.2 Food and Drink </c>
<br><br>
Food and drink are an important part of the game.  Your character can become hungry and thirsty, so it is wise to keep a moderate supply of food and water at all times. If you should run out of food and/or water, you will begin seeing the message <c "#66CCFF">"You are hungry."</c> or; <c "#66CCFF">"You are thirsty."</c> and your character will experience some negative effects. You will no longer regenerate health, mana, and stamina, which can be quite detrimental.  As long as your character has food and water in his possession he will eat and drink automatically.<br>
<br>
<c "#66CCFF">** NOTE:</c> Alcohol is not a sustaining drink and will not be consumed to prevent thirst.<br>
