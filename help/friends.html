<c "#ffff00"> 3.8 Friends and Ignore Lists </c>
<br><br>
As you gain levels and group with more people, you may find that you wish to keep track of some of your friends. Instead of taking the time to write them down on a notepad, use the <c "#B4B4B4">/friend Playername</c> command. This adds the person you name to your friends list. Use this in conjunction with the <c "#B4B4B4">/who</c> command to see which of your friends are online (<c "#B4B4B4">/who all friends</c>).<br>
<br>
In addition to a friends list, if you should ever find a need for it, there is an ignore list. When someone is added to this list, everything they say, emote, or otherwise do, will be filtered out of your chat box. The command to use is <c "#B4B4B4">/ignore playername</c>.<br>
<br>
<c "#66CCFF">** NOTE:</c> You may also bring up the friends window with ALT+F, which allows you to view and edit both your friends and ignore lists.<br>
