<c "#ffff00"> 3.6 Grouping </c>
<br><br>
The underlying appeal in a game like EverQuest is the social interaction between players, and grouping is a great way to start getting to know new people. If you are looking for a group and wish to inform others, type <c "#B4B4B4">/lfg on</c>. This will toggle a flag next to your name both in a <c "#B4B4B4">/who</c> and on the nametag above your head.<br>
<br>
When you find someone that you would like to group with, you may invite them to your group by targeting them and pressing CTRL+I. When you wish to leave a group, press CTRL+D to disband the group.<br>
<br>
<c "#66CCFF">** NOTE:</c> If you are the group leader, CTRL+D will disband the person whom you have targeted from the group.<br>
