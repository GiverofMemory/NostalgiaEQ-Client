You will notice a window on the bottom left of your screen entitled "Hotbuttons". This window has 10 pages of 10 hotbuttons each, allowing up to 100 different hotbuttons in total. To make a hotbutton, left-click and hold on the desired hotbutton for approximately 3 seconds. A box should appear on your cursor. Drag that box over to the hotbuttons window and drop it in one of the 10 slots. This works for your all your inventory slots and just about everything in the Main Menu window, as well as your spellbar. <br>
