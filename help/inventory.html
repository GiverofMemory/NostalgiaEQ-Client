<br><br>
To access the inventory window, press the <c "#66CCFF">[ I ]</c> key. In the center of this window are your equippable armor slots. On the bottom left of this window are your base inventory slots. When you obtain a new item, this is the window that you will use to equip it.<br>
<br>
To equip an item, simply left-click on it once to pick it up from your inventory, and drag it over to the black box in the center of the inventory window. Left-click there to drop it; this will place the item in the first available slot that it fits in.<br>
