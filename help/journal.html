<c "#ffff00">5.5 NPC Conversation Journal</c>
<br><br>
To open the Journal NPC window, use <c "#66CCFF">ALT-J</c> or click on the <c "#66CCFF">text bubble icon</c> on the Window Selector.
<br><br>
The NPC Conversation Journal consists of two windows.  The Journal NPC window and the Journal Dialogue window. The Journal NPC window displays the list of NPCs that you have journal entries for, while the Journal Dialogue window displays the individual journal entries for one of those NPCs.
<br><br>
In both of these windows you may sort the information by clicking on the column header for the column you wish to sort by.
<br><br>
The search feature makes it easier to find specific dialogues in large journals.  In the NPC window, click the <c "#66CCFF">Search</c> button, and enter the text that you are looking for.  The window will then display only those NPC's that have spoken that text.  The search button will now show the searched-for text (instead of the word Search).  To exit the search, click the <c "#66CCFF">Search</c> button.  A search in the NPC window will propagate to the Dialogue window, limiting your view to only those entries containing the searched-for text.  Again, this can be cancelled by clicking on the search button.
<br><br>
To begin recording what NPCs say to you in your journal, click on the <c "#66CCFF">Enable Journal Logging check box</c> in the top left of the window.  When this box is checked, the journal will record anything NPCs say to you.  The names of the NPCs with text recorded will show up on the list in the Journal NPC window.
<br><br>
To delete an NPC from the list, simply click on the entry to select it and then click on the <c "#66CCFF">Delete</c> button.  <c "#66CCFF">Deleting the NPC from this window will delete ALL text associated with that NPC.</c>
<br><br>
Clicking on one of these entries will open the Journal Dialogue window.  This window displays all of the journal entries for the selected NPC.
<br><br>
To delete an individual journal entry, click on the entry and click on the <c "#66CCFF">Delete</c> button.  This will only delete the individual entry.
<br><br>
You can create your own categories for journal entries.  Clicking on the <c "#66CCFF">Categories</c> button in the Journal NPC window will open up the Categories window.  Once you have created categories, you can assign them to journal entries in the Journal Dialogue window by clicking on the entry and selecting a category from the drop-down list.
<br><br>
To set a category as the default category, open the Journal Category window and choose a category from the drop-down list in the <c "#66CCFF">Default</c> box.  All new journal entries will be assigned to the default category.
<br><br>
In the Journal NPC window, you can filter the NPC list to only show NPC's with entries of a certain category by selecting that category in the Category selector.<br>
