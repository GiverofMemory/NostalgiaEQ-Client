You can open the Group Search window by typing /lfg or by clicking on the <c "#66CCFF">magnifying glass icon</c> in your Group window.

The Group Search window has two parts.  The upper portion (I am a:) is the place for entering information about what kind of group or player you are looking for, and the bottom section (Show me:) shows a list of results that match your search criteria.
<br><br>
Setting your LFG or LFP to ON makes your information available to others using the LFG tool so they can find you.
