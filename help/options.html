<br><br>
<c "#B4B4B4">/fastdrop ON/OFF/NEVER</c> - This toggles the ability to drop items on the ground without a confirmation box. The recommended setting for this option is the same as the default setting, which is /fastdrop off. If this is set to never, you will never be able to drop items on the ground. If this is set to on, you will always drop the item to the ground without a confirmation box. <br>
<br>
<c "#B4B4B4">/autojoin channel-list</c> - This saves the channels listed, and automatically sets you to join those channels when you log in.<br>
<br>
<c "#B4B4B4">/chatfontsize 1-5</c> - This changes the size of the chat font.<br>
<br>
<c "#B4B4B4">/filter </c> - This command will display a list of text filters to toggle on and off.<br>
<br>
<c "#B4B4B4">/inspect ON/OFF</c> - This toggles the ability to inspect others with a right click of the mouse. Use this if you use the mouse for movement, or find yourself accidentally inspecting others often. <br>
<br>
<c "#B4B4B4">/log ON/OFF</c> - This toggles the ability to log all text locally to the user's machine. The file that is generated can be found in your EverQuest directory. The format of the filename is eqlog_(server #)_(character name).txt.<br>
<br>
<c "#B4B4B4">/lootnodrop ALWAYS/SOMETIMES/NEVER</c> - This command specifies how you loot no drop items on corpses. "Always" is default and will cause a prompt box to always be shown when looting no drop items. Setting this to "sometimes" causes only items not usable by your character to show a prompt box. When you have this set to "never", you will never get a confirmation box choose whether or not to loot.<br>
<br>
<c "#B4B4B4">/mousespeed 0-3</c> - This changes the mouse travel speed across the monitor. 3 is the maximum setting (the higher the number the faster the mouse moves). Don't set this above 3. Your mouse will move too quickly and you will probably not be able to play.<br>
