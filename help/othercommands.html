<c "#ffff00"> 4.1.8 Other Commands  </c>
<br><br>
<c "#B4B4B4">/duel</c> or <c "#B4B4B4">/d</c> - Challenges the targeted PC to a duel. To accept, they have to type <c "#B4B4B4">/d</c> with you targeted as well. Duel is in effect until one combatant "dies" (is knocked unconscious) or flees the zone. Until the duel is resolved, the two combatants can't be affected by spells from PCs not in the duel, nor can they cast spells on those outside the duel.<br>
<br>
<c "#B4B4B4">/decline</c> - Declines a duel.<br>
<br>
<c "#B4B4B4">/camp desktop/server</c> - Allows the player to exit to the server select screen or desktop depending on what is specified. You can use just <c "#B4B4B4">/camp</c> by itself as well. You must be sitting in order for this command to work. If attacked while camping out, the /camp command will be cancelled, thus preventing exit from the game.<br>
<br>
<c "#B4B4B4">/quit</c> - Immediately exits the game. However, when you exit in this manner, your character has not 'camped out' in the proper fashion, and he or she will remain in the game world for a short period after you have quit. Your character will be under the control of the server, and may very well die while you are not there to tell it what to do. So only use this command when you are in a rush to leave the game or are in an in-game situation that you can't get out of with the standard sit and camp method. The risk you take when using this shortcut to exit the game is all yours.<br>
<br>
<c "#B4B4B4">/exit</c> - This command is the same as <c "#B4B4B4">/quit</c> and should not be used by players unless to escape from a death bind loop.<br>
<br>
<c "#B4B4B4">/gems</c> - Allows a player to play the game Gems.<br>
<br>
<c "#B4B4B4">/language</c> - Returns the number of the language that you are currently speaking. <c "#B4B4B4">/language [help]</c> returns a list of languages and their identification number. <c "#B4B4B4">/language [#]</c> sets the current language.<br>
