<c "#ffff00"> 3.1 Player Corpses </c>
<br><br>
There are a few things that one should know about player corpses. First, since players will not be required to retrieve their corpses to get their items back until level 11, all corpses created between levels 1 and 10 will last 30 minutes on or offline. When this timer has expired, the corpse will be removed from the world. Once a player reaches the 11th level, their corpse will remain in the world for a period of 7 days, on or offline, at which point, they will "decay".<br>
<br>
The second thing one should know about is the ability to "drag" corpses to a safe area. To do this, get near the corpse and type /cor, this will pull the corpse to your feet. You may also consent someone else to drag your corpse by using the <c "#B4B4B4">/consent Playername</c> command.<br>
<br>
The final thing one should know about corpses is that, you do have the ability to turn off player corpses using the <c "#B4B4B4">/hidecorpse</c> command. Listed below are the arguments that you may use with this command, as well as their functionality.<br>
<br>
<c "#B4B4B4">* /hidecorpse all</c> - This command will hide all corpses but yours.<br>
<br>
<c "#B4B4B4">* /hidecorpse group</c> - This command will hide all corpses, except those of your groupmates.<br>
<br>
<c "#B4B4B4">* /hidecorpse none</c> - This command will allow all corpses to be displayed.<br>
