<c "#ffff00"> 3.11 Player Window </c>
<br><br>
The player window is the window on your screen with your name on it. You will notice that there are three colored bars on this window. These are a graphical representation of your <c "#FF0000">Health,</c><c "#0000FF"> Mana,</c> and <c "#ffff00">Stamina</c> (listed in order from top to bottom.) <br>
<br>
The <c "#FF0000">Health Bar</c> is typically the most important. If you run out of health, your character will die, and you will need to retrieve your corpse. When it is time to regenerate health, sitting will increase your regeneration rate, effectively causing your character to rest up.<br>
<br>
The second bar is your mana, if you are a caster. The <c "#0000FF">Mana Bar</c> is also very important, since it is the only representation of your ability to cast spells. Once you have depleted this bar, you will no longer be able to cast spells until your mana regenerates. As with health, sitting will increase the regeneration rate of your mana pool.<br>
<br>
The third, and final bar (second bar if you are a melee) is the <c "#ffff00">Stamina Bar</c>. This is a graphical representation of your characters fatigue, which is also tied in to your characters stamina rating. You are able to see the stamina rating in the inventory window. <br>
