<c "#ffff00"> 2.5 Quick Cash </c>
<br><br>
When you start, your character will have enough food and drink to last for a while, but eventually you are going to need to purchase more. Perhaps you'll want better armor or spells. For this, you will need money.<br>
<br>
The best way to get that money is to defeat enemies. In the areas just outside the city, you will be able to find small creatures, often in plague proportions. You can aid your fellow citizens and earn cash in the process by defeating these pests and looting their corpses. Merchants will buy most of these items for a few copper pieces. It's not much, but it's a start.<br>
