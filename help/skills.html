<c "#ffff00"> 2.6 Skills </c>
<br><br>
Your character possesses a few basic skills at the start of the game. Everyone can beg, fish, bind their wounds, and use sense heading. Some skills, such as Elvish or Pick Lock, are only known to characters of a specific race or class. Other that you don't initially know can be learned as you gain levels and experience.<br>
<br>
In order to use a skill you know, you will want to place it on an easily accessible hot key button. To do this, first click on the abilities tab on the main menu window. Right click on an empty hot button slot and select a skill from the list to assign to that button. Click on that hotbutton to use the skill.<br>
<br>
