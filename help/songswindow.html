<c "#ffff00"> 3.10 Songs Window </c>
<br><br>
There are two windows with translucent backgrounds, the second of these is the songs window. Bard songs are quite similar to spells, however, there are some differences. The main difference with bard songs is that they are generally a pulsing effect, as opposed to a longer duration spell. Since these songs have such a short duration, this box was created specifically for them.<br>
<br>
<c "#66CCFF">** NOTE:</c> Not all bard songs are filtered to this window; there are still a couple that will occupy an "Effects" spell slot.<br>
