<br><br>
To scribe a spell, you must own the spell scroll, be of sufficient level to use the spell, and that spell must not already exist in your spellbook. First, open your spellbook by pressing CTRL+B (or clicking the spellbook icon at the bottom of the spellcasting bar.) Second, pick the spell up and drag it over to an empty spell slot in the spellbook and left click. This will begin the process of scribing a spell.<br>
<br>
To memorize a spell, left click on the spell you just scribed to select it, then drag it over to the spell casting bar and left click on the slot you wish to place the spell in. This will begin the process of memorizing a spell.<br>
