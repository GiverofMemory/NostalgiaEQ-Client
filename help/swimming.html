<br><br>
Your character will begin swimming when he/she enters the water. You will notice a new gauge on your screen when you are submerged that represents how much air you have left. When you begin to run low on air, use <a href="file:///help/mouselook.html"> Mouse-look </a> (or the <c "#66CCFF">[PageUp]</c> key) to look up, then swim forward to get your head above the water.<br>
