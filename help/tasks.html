<c "#ffff00"> 3.14 Task System </c>
<br><br>
<c "#66CCFF">Overview</c><br>
Tasks allow you to gain meaningful rewards on your own in a relatively short period of time.<br>
<br>
<c "#66CCFF">Acquiring Tasks</c><br>
To acquire a task, find a task master within the world. Common locations include home cities for lower-level tasks, as well as higher-level areas like Butcherblock Mountains, Dreadlands, Overthere, Swamp of No Hope, Toxxulia Forest and more.<br>
<br>
To find a task master, enter a zone and bring up the find window by pressing <c "#66CCFF">[Ctrl - F]</c>. You can sort the NPCs you can find in the zone by Category. Search for Task Master. Go to the task master and hail him or her to start a conversation and they will ask you to participate in a task.<br>
<br>
Inquiring about the tasks will bring up a task selection window. The tasks available to you will fit your level and class and will be centralized around the area that the task master is found in. You can choose one task from the list available to you. Once you have accepted a task, it will show in the Task Window.<br>
<br>
To access the Task Window, press <c "#66CCFF">[Alt - Q]</c>. There are three sections to the task window: Active Tasks, Task Progression, and the task's objective descriptions and your reward for completing the task.<br>
<br>
<c "#66CCFF">Task Window</c><br>
Active Tasks are located at the top of the window. When you have a task listed, you will see the title of the task and the time left to complete it. Clicking on the task will display additional information.<br>
<br>
Task Progression lists all objectives that need to be finished before the task is complete. The objectives you know about or are able to work on will show up immediately. You will see the zone the objective must be completed in, the instructions to complete the objective, and the number required. For example, this might be the number of times you need to kill a monster or loot an item.<br>
<br>
Those objectives not immediately available will be grayed out and listed as question marks. Completing preceding objectives will unlock the hidden objectives. Once an objective has been completed, it will be marked in green and the status will be listed as Done.<br>
<br>
Some tasks will have hail or delivery objectives. These objectives will cause a line to appear on your compass which points in the direction of the NPC required to complete the objective.<br>
<br>
A description outlining what you must accomplish for one or more objectives will be listed in the last section. The rewards you will obtain for completing the task in its entirety are also shown here. Common rewards are experience and coin.<br>
<br>
Some rewards are hidden. In such an instance, they will be listed as question marks, similar to hidden objectives. You will only discover what your reward is when the task is completed.<br>
<br>
<c "#66CCFF">Abandoning and Requesting Tasks</c><br>
You can abandon a task at any time by pressing the Abandon button in the Task Window. This will remove the task from your list. You will not receive a reward for an abandoned task, but you will be able to select a new one almost immediately.<br>
<br>
The request timer at the top of the window displays the amount of time remaining before you can request another task. After inquiring to a task master about tasks, you will have a 30-second delay before you can request another one. After successful completion of a task, you will have anywhere from 30 minutes to 90 minutes before you can request another one.<br>
<br>
This delay is calculated from the time you first accepted your task. If you accept a task at 6 p.m. with a one-hour time limit and complete it at 6:15 p.m., you will have a 15-minute delay before you can request another one.<br>
<br>
Each task has an individual time limit and request timer associated with it. Shorter tasks have a one-hour time limit and a 30-minute request timer. Medium tasks have a one-and-a-half hour time limit and a 60-minute request timer. Long tasks have a two-hour time limit and a 90-minute request timer.<br>
