Alternate Advancement abilities are only available to characters of level 51 and over (this also requires the purchase of The Shadows of Luclin or The Planes of Power).
<br><br>
- <c "#66CCFF">To purchase Alternate Advancement (AA) abilities</c>, your character will need to earn Alternate Advancement experience by setting the Exp. to AA slider to some number above 0.  This indicates the amount of future earned experience that goes toward earning AA points.
<br><br>
For more information about experience, please see the <a WndNotify="1000,help.html">Help</a> section about <a WndNotify="1000,experience.html">Experience</a>.
