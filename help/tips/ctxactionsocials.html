<br><br>
Socials can be a variety of things, from emotes to spell-casting macros.
<br><br>
- <c "#66CCFF">Look at the pre-set socials as examples for creating your own.</c> 
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">To create a new or edit an existing social</c>, simply right-click on the button once.  The socials creation window will pop up. 
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">You can place a /pause in your social</c>, but keep in mind that when one social is paused, you can't use any others.  /pause takes an argument from 1 to 600 (600 = One minute),
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">/doability # (where # is 1-10) can be included in your socials.</c>  This activates the skill of the appropriate number from your Actions Skills list.
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">/cast # (where # is 1-8) can be included in your socials.</c>  This casts the spell of the appropriate number from your Spells window.
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">There are several special characters that can be included in your socials:</c>
<br>
<c "#66CCFF">%M</c> - Returns the character's pet's name (when they have a pet)
<br>
<c "#66CCFF">%T</c> - Returns the current target.
<br>
<c "#66CCFF">%S</c> - Returns the subjective gender-specific pronoun for the target (He, She, It).
<br>
<c "#66CCFF">%O</c> - Returns the objective gender-specific pronoun for the target (Him, Her, It).
<br>
<c "#66CCFF">%P</c> - Returns the possessive gender-specific pronoun for the target (His, Her, Its).
<br>
<c "#66CCFF">%R</c> - Returns the race of the target (only works on Player characters).
