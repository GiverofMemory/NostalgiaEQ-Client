The address book is your personal contact list.  Each entry has a case-insensitive nickname that you use to identify one or more character addresses.

<br><br>
- <c "#66CCFF">To change the content of your address book</c> you just need to fill in the name, addresses and note fields.  The main button used to insert the information in the address book will be labeled "Add" if the name is not already in the address book, "Replace" if the name exists but is not the currently selected entry, or "Modify" if the currently selected entry is being modified.

<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">You can flag the entry name as private</c> to prevent it from being sent to the recipients.  Just before sending the message, the addresses will be expanded individually instead of being sent as part of a named list.

<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">The Guild mailing list</c> is read-only and automatically kept up-to-date for you.  You can however make a copy of it by selecting the Guild entry and changing its name.  After you press the "Add" button, you can edit the list of addresses and the note.

<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">You can add a recipient to the "to" field of the mail composition window</c>.  If the currently selected entry has not been modified, you can press the "Mail To" button and the name will be inserted at the end of the list of recipients.  You can also secretly add a recipient by first pressing the left ALT key, and the button will be labeled "Secret To".

<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">The address book is saved in a client file.</c>  The notes are never sent to the server and are completely private.  Your list names are public unless you mark them as private.  By default, all characters shared one address book stored in your EverQuest user data directory.  You can change which address book to use when playing the current character by going to the mail options.
