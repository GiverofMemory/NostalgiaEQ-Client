<br><br>
The Wayfarers Brotherhood have many interesting adventures for you.  You can find them in North Ro, South Ro, Everfrost Peaks, the Butcherblock Mountains and East Commons.  To get an adventure, form a group and seek out the Wayfarers.  The group leader must Right-click on the Adventure Recruiter or the Raid Recruiter to be given an adventure.
<br><br>
These adventures take place in dungeon "instances".  This means that a copy of the dungeon is created just for your group, and no others can enter it.  You will have a limited time to complete your task, so keep moving.  Here are some other tips about the adventure window.
<br><br>
- Only the group or raid leader can start an adventure for your group or raid.
<br>
- Your group or raid must be complete before the group or raid leader accepts the adventure.  Only characters in your group or raid when the adventure is requested will be able to enter the dungeon.
<br>
- If you decline an adventure, you will have to wait a short while before another will become available.
<br>
- The group or raid leader can choose a Normal or Hard risk for the adventure.  If the group or raid leader chooses Hard the adventure will be more difficult but will also yield greater reward.
<br>
- Once you accept an adventure, a waypoint represented by a blue line will appear on your compass to help guide you to the entrance of the dungeon when you are in the appropriate zone.
<br>
- The Time to Enter shows you how long you have to locate and enter the dungeon portal.  If you do not enter the portal before the timer expires, your adventure will end.
<br>
- Once you enter, the Time to Complete shows you how long you have to reach your objective.  If you do not complete your adventure by then, the adventure will close down.
<br>
- If at any point you leave, complete, or fail your adventure you can still enter the dungeon and retrieve your corpse, as long as the dungeon is still open.
<br>
- Any time that a dungeon instance shuts down, all PC corpses and any living PCs will be placed outside the dungeon at the portal used to enter the dungeon.
<br>
- The View Stats button will show you your adventure statistics, and from the Stats window you can access the adventure Leaderboard.

<c "#66CCFF">Here are some tips about group adventures:</c>

<br><br>
- You must be in a group of at least 3 members to get an adventure.
<br>
- Your group members must all be of a similar level (within about 6 or 7 levels of each other).
<br><br>

<c "#66CCFF">Here are some tips about raid adventures:</c>
<br><br>
- You must be in a raid group of at least 18 members to get a raid adventure, up to a maximum of 36.
<br>
- Your raid members must all be at least level 60, with a required level average of 63. 
<br>
- Each member of your raid must complete at least two adventures in the theme you wish to raid in.
<br>
- Once you have successfully completed or failed a raid adventure, you will need to wait five real-life days to do the same raid adventure again.  For example, if you take on the raid in Deepest Guk, when you fail or succeed on that raid, you will have to wait five days to try again.
