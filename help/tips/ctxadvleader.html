- Your rank on the selected leader board will always display at the 
bottom of the window. 
<BR>
- Use the category dropdown box at the top to choose which leaderboard you want to see. You may see those that have the most wins over all or for each theme. You may also list those with the best win percentage 
(ratio of wins to attempts) over all or for each theme.
<BR>
- Choosing a new category listing refreshes the list. 
<BR>
- There is a short delay between category changes and uses of the Refresh button. 
<BR>
- You must have attempted at least 25 adventures to qualify for a win percentage ranking.
