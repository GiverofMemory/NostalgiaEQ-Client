<br><br>
- Augmentation Items can be found in Lost Dungeon of Norrath zones and for sale from the Adventure Merchants.
<br>
- The Augmentation Items can be used to improve items and equipment that show open slots.  An item can have up to three slots available for Augmentation Items.  The open slots are named Slot 1, Slot 2, Slot 3 which can be seen when you examine an item. Upon examination, each slot will show that it can accept a specific Augmentation Item type.  The Augmentation Item shows which type it is when you examine it.
<br>
- Augmentation Items are categorized by types and often carry restrictions for certain equipment slots (i.e. neck, waist, feet pieces) and slot types available on your item.
<br>
- To apply an Augmentation Item to a slot on a piece of equipment, you will need to use an Augmentation Sealer, which can be found at each Wayfarers Brotherhood camp.  Place the Augmentation Item and the compatible piece of equipment into the open slots of the Augmentation Sealer and click "Combine." Your new augmented item will be created! 
<br>
- If you wish to remove the Augmentation Item, you can buy solvents from one of the magi at each of the five Wayfarers Brotherhood camps.  There is a solvent for each of the three slot types.  For example, a Slot 1 Solvent will remove the Augmentation Item from Slot 1 of your equipment. Take your item with the Augmentation Item you wish to remove and the appropriate solvent and put them into the Augmentation Sealer.  Click "Combine."  The Augmentation Item will be removed and destroyed.  Be careful not to misuse your Augmentation Items!
