- <c "#66CCFF">The banker will change your coins for you.</c>  If you take 20 copper pieces and drop them into the bank window where it indicates silver pieces are stored, the banker will automatically change your 20 copper into 2 silver.
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">Click on the "Change" button</c> to convert all your coin, both in the bank and on your person, to the fewest possible coins.
<br>
