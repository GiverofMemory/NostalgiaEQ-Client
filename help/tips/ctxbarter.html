<c "#DCF000">Barter Buyer Tips</c>
<br><br>
This window is used to create Buy Lines for things you'd like other players to sell to you.  You can search for items to buy, select compensation, manage your Buy Lines, as well as seeing what has happened while AFK.
<br><br>
Note that the compensation you select for a Buy Line is for EACH time the Buy Line is performed.  If you set up a Buy Line to buy an item 5 times, then all the items/coin you list in compensation will be given to the seller each of the 5 times someone sells that item to you.
<br><br>
- <c "#66CCFF">To search for Buyable items</c>, enter the name (or part of it) of the item you'd like to Buy in the search text entry, then click Search.  A list of Barter-able items should display in the list above.  Select one of the items listed to start creating a Buy Line for that item.
<br><br>
- <c "#66CCFF">To select the compensation for an item</c>, change the values in the coin slots and select items that you will give each time someone sells you the Buy item.
<br><br>
- <c "#66CCFF">To create the Buy Line</c>, after selecting the Buy item and the compensation, enter how many times you'd like to buy the item, then click Create.
<br><br>
- <c "#66CCFF">To modify a Buy Line</c>, select the Buy Line, then modify the compensation and click the Modify button.  No changes will be stored unless the Modify button is pressed.
