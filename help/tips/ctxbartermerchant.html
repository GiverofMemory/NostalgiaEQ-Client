This window is used to sell items to Barter Buyers.  The items the Buyer wants are listed in the Buy Line list.  The lines in white are the ones for which you currently have the item the Buyer wants in your inventory.
<br><br>
- <c "#66CCFF">To view the item compensation for a sale</c>, click on the item in the Buy Lines list, and the items (if any) that you will receive (in addition to the coin listed) will be displayed below.  Click on an item in that lower list and click the "View Item" button to see the stats of that item.
<br><br>
- <c "#66CCFF">To sell an item to the Buyer</c>, click on the Buy Line that represents the item you wish to sell and the price you want, then click "Sell".  Note that if you don't have the item in question, the Buy Line will show in red and you will not be able to click the Sell button.
