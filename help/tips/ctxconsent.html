Someone has just given you consent to drag their corpse.
<br><br>
- <c "#66CCFF">You can now move their corpse using the /corpse command.</c>  Just target the corpse and type /corpse and if you are close enough, the corpse will be dragged to you.
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">Use the Social.</c>  There is a Corpse social in your action window.  Using this can make dragging corpses easier.
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">To give someone consent</c> on you own corpse, type /consent {character name}.
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">Be careful who you consent.</c>  It's easy for someone to place your corpse in a hard to recover location.
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">Be polite when given consent.</c>  You are playing in a very social environment and if you do something mean to someone, like dragging their corpse to a bad spot, you can harm your reputation.
