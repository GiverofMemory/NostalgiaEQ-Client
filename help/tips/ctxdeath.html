Unfortunately, you have just died.  The good news is that if your character is level 9 or under, you have revived with all of your items and with no experience loss.  This will not be the case after you reach 10th level.  At that time you will need to recover your items from your corpse, which will be in the spot where you were killed.  You will also lose a small amount of experience as a result of dying.

<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">To help you find your corpse</c>, Bards, Necromancer and Shadowknights have spells that locate and even summon corpses.  It's a good idea to offer a reward for such services, even if you have to get that reward off your corpse.
