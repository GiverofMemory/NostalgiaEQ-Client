- <c "#66CCFF">The Far Clip Plane</c> determines how far you can see.  Obviously, the farther you can see, the more work your computer has to do to draw everything.  Reducing the Far Clip Plane can help improve your framerate (how quickly things are drawn on your screen).
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">The Near Clip Plane</c> only relates to spell particles.  It determines how close to your viewpoint particles can be seen.  Near means that particles can appear very close to the camera (your viewpoint).  Farthest would mean that particles that might appear near your point of view will not be drawn.  Pushing the Near Clip Plane out can improve your framerate, but you will see fewer spell effects.
