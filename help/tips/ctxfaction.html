You have just received a faction message.  The message tells you that a certain group (for example, The Coalition of Tradesfolk) has changed their opinion of you.  If the message says that you have gained faction with that group, then they like you more than they did.  If it says that you have lost faction with that group, then they like you less.  
<br><br>
- <c "#66CCFF">Complete quests and defeat foes to change your faction.</c>  Completing quests and killing NPCs are the most common methods for changing your faction, for better or worse.
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">Be careful who you anger.</c>  Losing too much faction with the wrong people may make it very difficult for you to enter a city.  Some quest-giving NPCs may not offer quests to you if you are not well liked by his faction.
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">It is easier to lose faction than to gain it.</c>  Killing their enemies may make them like you, but not as much as they will dislike you for killing one of their own.
