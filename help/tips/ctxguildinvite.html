Someone has just invited you to join a guild.  Joining a guild can be a great experience.  Being in a guild of like-minded players will make your game experience much more fun.
<br><br>
- <c "#66CCFF">Make sure you know what guild you are joining.</c>  It's a good idea to have played with the guild members before accepting their invitation.  And you should know what the guild likes to do, make sure that they have the same interests that you do.
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">To remove yourself from a guild</c>, type /guildremove.  Make sure you really want to leave the guild, because you will have to be invited back to rejoin.
