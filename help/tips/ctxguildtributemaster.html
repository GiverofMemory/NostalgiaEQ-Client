<br><br>
This window displays your current Guild Tribute status (favor accumulated, active benefit costs, etc.), as well as giving you the opportunity to donate to the Guild Favor pool.  Officers and the Guild Leader can also select up to 2 Benefits that the entire guild will receive.
<br><br>
- <c "#66CCFF">To donate an item</c>, click on the item in your inventory and click the Donate button.
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">To donate cash (platinum only)</c>, click on the platinum button above the Donate button, use the quantity selector to choose an amount,
then click the Donate button.
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">To Activate selected benefits</c>, which can not be done while the Tribute Master Window is in use, the Guild Leader or an Officer must click on the Activate button on the Tribute Benefit Window (Guild tab).  When this is done, members will receive their Benefits (if opted-in), and the Guild Pool will be charged.
<BR>
- <c "#66CCFF">To select/upgrade a benefit</c>, click the benefit in the Master list, then click the Upgrade button.  Each click will select
the next tier of the benefit.  Note that higher tiers generally have higher level requirements and favor maintenance costs; only guild members who are online, opted in, and whose level qualifies for the benefit tier will receive the benefit and require payment.
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">To deselect/downgrade a benefit</c>, click the benefit in the Active list, then click the downgrade button.  Each click will
lower the active tier by 1 until the benefit is completely deactivated.
<br><br>
- <c "#66CCFF">Current Favor</c> shows how much Favor is available to use.
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">Active Cost</c> is the number of Favor points that will be expended when Benefits are Activated, and at every interval thereafter.  This will pay for all active members who are receiving benefits, and can change based on members going on/offline, opting in/out, or gaining levels.
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">Level displayed</c> is the minimum level needed to gain the benefit.
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">Cost listed</c> is the number of favor points needed to maintain the benefit per guild member that is online and receiving the benefit.
