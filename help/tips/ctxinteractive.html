<BR><BR>
You have discovered an interactive object! These objects often appear as 
boxes, vases, crates, coffins, barrels, and other items, so keep your eyes open 
for objects you can target by clicking on them with your cursor. 
<BR><BR>
- Under the abilities tab in the Actions window, you will see that you have gained two 
new abilities. One is named "Open," and allows you to open interactive objects 
when you have it selected and it is unlocked. The other new ability is named 
"Inspect," which allows you to get more information on an interactive object 
when you have it selected. 
<BR><BR>
- The following is a list of the other ways to interact with these objects: 
<BR>
- Melee - You can hit the chest in order to break it open. Beware though, some objects are trapped and may be destroyed if 
tampered with too much. 
<BR>
- Sense Trap - If you are a class that has the Sense Trap ability, you can check to see if the chest you want to open is armed with a 
trap. 
<BR>
- Disarm Trap - If you have the Disarm Trap ability, you can disarm a 
trap that guards an object you want to open. 
<BR>
- Pick Lock - If you are a class that has the ability to pick locks, you can pick the locked objects you 
want to open. 
<BR>
- Opening Objects with Spells - Magic using classes can seek out spells that will allow them to open interactive objects that are locked or 
trapped via magical means.
