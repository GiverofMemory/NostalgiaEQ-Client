<br><br>
- <c "#66CCFF">To reduce the number of extraneous entries</c>, you may want to turn journal logging off until you need it.
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">Remember to turn the Journal logging back on when you do need it.</c>
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">If you forgot to turn it on</c> and you haven't gone too far from the NPC, turn it on and go back and chat with the NPC again.
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">Turning off Journal logging will cause journal entries to no longer display.</c>  Don't worry, they are still there, and will reappear when you turn the logging back on.
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">To sort the list, just click on the header of the column you wish to sort on.</c>
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">To find a specific entry</c>, click on the Search button and enter the text you are looking for.  This will filter the window to display only items with the text you specified.
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">Deleting an NPC deletes all of the entries associated with that NPC.</c>  So be certain that you want to delete everything that the NPC has told you before you delete it.
