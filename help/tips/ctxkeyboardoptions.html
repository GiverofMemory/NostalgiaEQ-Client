- <c "#66CCFF">You can remap your keys</c> to help configure the keyboard for your play style.  Just find the key you wish to change on the list (you may need to change categories in the dropdown list above the key listing).  Click on the key that you want to change in the Keypress column.  Then hit the key or key combination that you would like to activate the command.
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">You may want to remap the Autoattack command.</c>  This command it set to the "a" key.  It is not uncommon for people to accidentally hit this key when trying to type a message.  To reduce the chance that you will accidentally attack your guild master, you may wish to remap this key.
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">The Reload Default resets all the keys to their default</c>, so don't worry about making a mistake.
