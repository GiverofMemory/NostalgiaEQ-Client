Leadership experience works very similar to regular experiences, but 	it is a separate system and there are some key differences:
<br>
-	Leadership experience is earned by the leader of a group or raid when 	their group or raid gets a kill. 
<br>
-	When gaining leadership experience, a group or raid leader will receive 20% less regular experience.
<br>
-	You can turn off leadership experience if you wish to earn regular experience at its standard rate.
<br>
-	As a character earns leadership experience, his leadership experience bar will fill up.  Once the bar is full, the character will gain 1 	raid 	or group leadership point.
<br>
-	You can use raid and group leadership points and spend them to learn leadership abilities.
<br>
-	The leader will not gain leadership experience if the NPC killed is not at least dark blue to the highest level member of the group or 	raid.
<br>
-	Raid leadership is separate from group leadership.

Here are some tips on Leadership abilities: 
<br>
-	A character can save up raid and group leadership points and spend them to learn leadership abilities.
<br>
-	A character can only save a certain number of points based on their level and the leadership point type.
<br>
-	The maximum number of points that a character can save increases as they level
<br>
-	You can see your character's current maximum in the Leadership window (L key)
<br>
-	Only the group leader's abilities will be available to the group. 
<br>
-	Only the raid leader's abilities will be available to the raid.
<br>
-	Individual group leaders in a raid will be able to use their group leadership abilities (not their raid leadership abilities).
<br><br>
-	Some abilities are passive and do not need to be activated.
<br>
-	Other abilities can be activated by creating hotkeys for them in the Leadership Window.  Some of them can also be activated using slash commands:
<br><br>
/findpc <name> -- finds the named PC
<br>
/inspectbuffs -- inspects the buffs of the targeted player
<br>
/gmarknpc <mark> -- group mark npc (<mark> = 1, 2, or 3)
<br>
/marknpc <mark> -- group mark npc (<mark> = 1, 2, or 3)
<br>
/rmarknpc <mark> -- raid mark npc (<mark> = 1, 2, or 3)
<br>
/clearmarks -- removes all marks from NPCs
<br>
/assist group -- targets the player the Group Main Assist has targeted
<br>
/assist raid -- targets the nearest player that any Raid Main Assist has targeted
<br>
/assist main -- targets the nearest player that any Group or Raid Main Assist has targeted
<br>
