Congratulations on achieving 10th level!

- <c "#66CCFF">From now on, when you die you will need to recover your corpse.</c>  Until you reach 10th level you return to life with all of your items.  From now on, your items will remain on your corpse, and you will need to recover them.
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">As soon as you reach 11th level, you will lose experience points when you die.</c>  Death takes a toll on you, and along with the need to recover your items, you will lose some experience with each death.
