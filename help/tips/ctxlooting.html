- <c "#66CCFF">To loot items most efficiently</c>, right-click on the item on the corpse and it will be placed in your inventory (or equipped if appropriate).
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">Coins on the corpse are taken automatically by the first person to loot the corpse.</c>
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">Autosplitting (/autosplit) coins is often the fairest way to distribute coins</c>, but talk to your group about this, some people may not want any coins.
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">Be polite about looting.</c>  Make sure that loot is shared with your group, don't take all the stuff.  Also, don't loot corpses that may have been killed by other players without asking first.
