<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">The mail system icon in the selector window will blink when you receive new messages.</c>
It will appear lit (with a yellow background) as long as you have unread messages in your inbox.  If the mail system servers are down, it will appear with a red background.

<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">The current mailbox</c> is by default the one belonging to the character your are playing.
You can quickly switch to your other character mailboxes on that server.

<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">The message list is, by default, sorted by date, the most recent message at the top.</c>
You can sort by sender, subject or date by clicking on the corresponding column header.
Clicking again on a column header reverses the sorting order.

<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">You can select multiple messages at once.</c>
A <b>mouse click</b> only selects one message at a time.
To select a range of messages, click on the first one and <b>SHIFT-click</b> on the last one.
You can also individually toggle your selections using <b>CTRL-click</b>.

<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">You can only reply to, reply to all, or forward one message at a time.</c>
The corresponding buttons are only enabled when exactly one message is selected in your inbox.

<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">You can report inappropriate messages to Customer Service.</c>
The <b>report button</b> will make the selected messages accessible to Customer Service.

<br>
- The <c "#66CCFF">address book</c> and the <c "#66CCFF">mail options</c> buttons are found in the upper
right corner of the mail window.
