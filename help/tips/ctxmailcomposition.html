<br>

<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">The From: field</c> reflects the currently selected character mailbox (see mail window).  Make sure you check this before pressing the Send button, as the message will be sent on the behalf of that character.

<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">The To: field</c> is a coma-separated list of recipients.  A recipient can be an address or a mailing list.

<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">An address</c> can be as simple as the name of a character, if he plays on the same server as you.  If he plays on a different server, you must qualify it with its short server name: "Cazic.Kagok".  You can even send a message to a character playing in another SOE game such as EverQuest II or Star Wars Galaxies (e.g "SOE.EQ2.Cazik.AntoniaBayle").

<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">A mailing list</c> is a name followed by a space-delimited list of addresses, all placed between angle brackets, such as "The Wizards of Norrath <Cazic.Aldebaran Berenice EQ2.Innoruuk.Cassiopeia>".  If the mailing list in your address book, just type "The Wizards of Norrath" and the list will be expanded before being sent.

<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">You can blind copy a message</c> by putting a '-' character in front of a recipient name.
As an example, "TO: Dracken, -The Wizards of Norrath, SWG.Tatooine.Luke" will reach Dracken on your current server, Luke on Tatooine and the three wizards as defined in your address book, but they will only see "TO: Dracken, SWG.Tatooine.Luke" when they open the message.

<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">When a mailing list appears in long form in your To: field</c>, you can press the synchronization button (the one with a checkmark icon) to update your address book.  This is especially useful when you respond to a message by pressing the Reply All button in the mail window.  If it's a new list, you can add it to your address book.  If the list is different because the name has letters with a different case, or the address list has changed, you will be asked if you want to apply the changes.
