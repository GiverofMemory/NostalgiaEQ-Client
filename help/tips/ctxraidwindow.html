The Raid Leader can organize the raid into groups by using the top row of buttons in the bottom section of the Raid Window.
<BR><BR>
The raid must first be locked by clicking the 'Lock' button.  While the raid is locked, the raid organization buttons are enabled, and players are prevented from using group commands to invite new players, disband from their groups, or change group leaders.
<BR><BR>
The Raid Leader can then move players among groups by clicking on their names in the Raid Window and using the group buttons.  Clicking the 'NoGroup' button will remove the selected player from their group and place them in the 'Players not in a Group' list.  Clicking a numbered button will move the selected player into the correspondingly numbered group.  If a player is moved into an empty group, that player will become the Group Leader of a new group once the second player is added.  If removal of a player leaves a group with only one remaining player, the group will be disbanded.
<BR><BR>
The raid is only allowed to have 12 players designated as Group Leaders at any given time.  To remove Group Leader designation from a player in the 'Players not in a Group' list, select them in the list and click 'RemLeader'.
<BR><BR>
Once the Raid Leader is finished organizing the raid, they should click the 'Unlock' button to once again allow players to use group commands.
