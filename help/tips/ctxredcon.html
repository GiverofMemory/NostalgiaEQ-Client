You have just tried to attack an NPC which is probably too difficult for you to defeat.  You can take a close look at another character or NPC by typing /con with that character targeted or by right clicking on them.  
<br><br>
The chat window then displays the NPC's attitude toward you and how difficult a battle you can expect.  The /con message is red when you consider this NPC, so you should be very cautious.
