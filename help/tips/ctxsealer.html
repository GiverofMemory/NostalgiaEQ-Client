- To apply an Augmentation Item to a slot on a piece of equipment, you 
will need to use the Augmentation Sealer. There is one at each Adventure camp. 
Place the Augmentation Item and the compatible piece of equipment into the open 
slots of the Augmentation Sealer and click "Combine." Your new augmented item 
will be created! 
<BR><BR>
- If you wish to remove the Augmentation Item, you can buy solvents at the Adventure Merchants, one for each of the three slot types 
available on an item. For example, a Slot 1 Solvent will remove the Augmentation 
Item from Slot 1 of your equipment. Take your item with the Augmentation Item 
you wish to remove and the appropriate solvent and put them into the 
Augmentation Sealer. Click "Combine." The Augmentation Item will be removed and 
destroyed. So, be careful not to misuse your Augmentation Items!
