The Storyline window displays information about the ongoing story of EverQuest, as well as historical tales of Norrath.
<br><br>
- <c "#66CCFF">Any time there is a new story the window will open when you log in.</c>
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">To prevent the Story window from opening when there is a new tale</c>, uncheck the box on the bottom left of the window.
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">The stories are displayed in the order that they are added</c>, so the newest ones are always on the top of the list.
