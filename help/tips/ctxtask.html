This window displays your list of currently active Tasks, along with how long you have left to complete each one.
<br>
The letter in the first column specifies whether the item is a single-player task ("T"), quest ("Q"), or shared task ("S").
<br><br>
- <c "#66CCFF">To display a Task's Elements</c>, select the Task in the Task List.  The Task's Elements should disply in the Elements List, as well as your current status in each Element.  Also, the Task's description will display in the window at the bottom of the Task Window.
<br><br>
- <c "#66CCFF">To abandon a Task</c>, select the Task in the Task List and click the Abandon button.  This will cancel that Task for you.  There are no penalties for cancelling a Task.
<br><br>
- <c "#66CCFF">When you complete a Task</c>, it will be removed from this list.  There will be a short delay from when you started that task before you can receive another.
<br><br>
The Shared Task tab shows a list of players in your current shared task.  If you are the shared task leader, you will be able to use the buttons to add or remove players, or assign a new leader.  You can also use these shared task commands:
<br>
<c "#66CCFF">/taskaddplayer <name>
<br>
/taskremoveplayer <name>
<br>
/taskmakeleader <name>
<br>
/taskquit
</c>
<br><br>
The Quest History tab shows a list of all quests ("Q") that you have completed, with the date and time of completion.  You can click on a quest in the list to see the elements you finished.
