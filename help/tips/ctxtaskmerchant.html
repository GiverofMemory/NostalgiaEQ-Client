- Any item you can afford to purchase will be displayed in the window to 
the right. The list will also show items that cost up to 50% more than the 
points you have available. Such items will be greyed out because you cannot yet 
afford them. 
<BR>
- You may wish to save your points. The more points you have to 
spend the more items you will see listed. 
<BR>

clicking on any of the headers (to sort by Price, just click on the blue Price 
title at the top of the column). 
<BR>
