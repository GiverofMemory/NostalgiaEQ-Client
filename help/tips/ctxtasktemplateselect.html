<br>
This window is used to select which monster you will use inside the monster mission.  The monster selection is only available for monster missions, and you will only
appear in monster form while inside the monster mission.<br>
<br>
<c "#DCF000">Window Explanation</c><br>
The window is divided into the following sections:<br>
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">Required Characters:</c><br>
These are the monsters that must be selected by player(s) assigned to the monster mission before anybody is allowed to enter the monster mission zone.  The monster 
mission may require 1 or more players to play as this monster.  The monster name will appear in red as long as the monster mission requires more player(s) to select 
this monster.  Once the name goes white or gray, it means the required number of players have selected this monster.  Note: not all monster missions have required
monsters.<br>
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">Optional Characters:</c><br>
These are monsters players may choose from, they are not required as a part of the monster mission.<br>
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">Stats Area:</c><br>
When a monster is selected (highlighted) in either the required or optional list, the monster's stats are displayed here.  These are the base stats of the player and do
not take into account any stat altering items or bufs.<br>
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">Abilities:</c><br>
These are the abilities of the selected (highlighted) monster.  Clicking the ability will bring up the ability's description in the help area.<br>
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">Equipment:</c><br>
This is the starting gear of the selected (highlighted) monster.  Clicking the item will bring up the item's description in the help area.<br>
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">Help Area:</c><br>
This area is used to give information about various aspects of the monster.  When a monster is selected (clicked on) in one of the monster lists, a brief description of 
that monster will be displayed here.  If an ability or item is clicked, then a description of that ability or item is displayed here.  The item descriptions work in
the same manner as other item description windows, clicking the item icon will add an item link to your chat input.<br>
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">Select Monster Button:</c><br>
This is used to select which monster you will be assigned inside the monster mission.  You must select a monster to use inside the monster mission, and Until make a
selection you will not be allowed into the monster mission zone.  Please see the "Notes" section for more rules regarding monster selection.<br>
<br>
<c "#DCF000">Notes:</c><br>
<br>
- The number next to a monster's name in the lists is the number of players assigned to the monster mission that are allowed to select that monster.  This number will
count down as players select the monster and once it is no longer available to other players, it will turn gray.  "--" instead of a number means there is no limit to how
many players may select this monster.<br>
<br>
- When you have selected a monster, the name of your selected monster will always appear in green in the monster list.<br>
<br>
- monster names in red are required monsters that still require player(s) to select them before anybody may enter the monster mission zone.<br>
<br>
- monster names in white are optional monsters that are available for selection.  Once a required monster goes from red to white, it means it is no longer a required
selection, but player(s) may still choose to select it.<br>
<br>
- monster names in gray are monsters that are no longer available for selection since they had a selection limit and the limit was reached.  eg: 1 player is allowed to
play as that monster, and a player has already chosen it.<br>
<br>
- This window can be brought up from the Task (Quest Journal) window.  Select the monster mission in the task window and the "Monster Select" button will be enabled.  
Clicking this button will show this selection window, or hide it if the window is already being shown.<br>
