<br>
This window allows you to choose your own title from a list of titles that you qualify for.  When the window is active your character is displayed on the screen, 
and you will see your name and title above your character's head.  The title that you see displayed is the title that is currently selected in the window, so 
that you can see how it will look to other players.  If the title is blue it means that this is your current title, if the title is yellow then it means this is 
a title that you are considering.  
<br>
<br>
To change your title click the "Change Title" button.  This will make the current selection your new title, and you should see the title change from yellow to blue. 
Once you change your title, all players around you will see the new title.
<br>
<br>
To remove your title (not have a title displayed) click the "Clear Title" button.  This makes it so that you no longer have a title displayed, although you will 
still see a yellow title above your head since you are in the window and have a title selected in the list.  Once you clear your title, all players around you 
will no longer see a title above your head.
