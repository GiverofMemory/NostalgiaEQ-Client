You have opened the trade window by clicking on a player character with an item on your cursor.
<br><br>
- <c "#66CCFF">Make certain that all the items in the trade window are what you expect them to be before clicking Trade.</c>  All trades are final, so point your mouse at (or right-click and hold) every item in both windows before clicking Trade.
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">Any change to the items in the Trade window resets the trade.</c>  If either person changes or adds an item to the trade after one person has clicked Trade, both will have to click Trade to complete the trade.  This is for your protection.  If you click Trade and find that you need to click it again, recheck all items in the windows to make certain that they are what you expect them to be.
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">All trades are final.</c>  If you make a trade and checked your items carefully, you will get exactly what you traded for, nothing more or less.  Make sure you are getting a deal that you are happy with.
<br>
- <c "#66CCFF">Make sure you have room for all incoming items.</c>  Some items are large and may not fit into your bags, or you may be gaining more items than you have room for.  These items may fall to the ground when the trade is concluded if they will not fit into your inventory, and may be snatched up by other PCs or NPCs.
