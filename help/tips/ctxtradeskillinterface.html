<br><br>
This window can be used to perform any tradeskill recipe you know with much fewer clicks than the old experimental interface.
<br><br>
- <c "#66CCFF">To get a list of recipes</c>, enter your search criteria (min and max trivial values and/or a partial name) and click Search.  All recipes that you know that can be combined in this container and match your criteria will display in the list.
<br><br>
- <c "#66CCFF">To open the container as a bag</c>, click on the Experiment button (or use Ctrl-rightclick to open the bag in the first place).  This will give you access to the contents of the container, if you had placed anything in it before.
<br><br>
- <c "#66CCFF">To combine a recipe</c>, select a recipe after performing a search, determine whether you have all the components (they should all have a green background, red means you don't have it in your inventory), then click Combine.  The results will appear on your cursor, which must be cleared before you can combine again.
<br><br>
- <c "#66CCFF">Favorites:</c> You can deem any recipe to be a "favorite" by selecting the recipe and clicking on Add underneath the Favorites label.  Favorite recipes that match your container will be displayed immediately when you open the container, and you can re-show your favorites at any time using the Show button.  Select a favorite recipe and click Remove to delete it from your favorites list.
<br><br>
- <c "#66CCFF">Auto-inventory</c> The Auto-Inventory button works just like the auto-inventory area in your inventory window.
<br><br>
- <c "#66CCFF">Use CtrlRClick</c> When this button is un-pressed (the default), then right-clicking on a tradeskill container brings up this interface, and Ctrl-Rightclicking the tradeskill container brings up the old "bag" interface.  Depressing the "Use CtrlRclick" button reverses these two.
