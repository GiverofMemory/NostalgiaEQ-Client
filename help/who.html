<c "#ffff00">3.7 The "/who" Command </c>
<br><br>
This is a very useful command that allows you to see who is online within the search parameters. Simply typing <c "#B4B4B4">/who</c> in the chat bar and hitting enter will bring up a list of everyone currently in the zone you are in. There is an additional argument that allows you to run a search worldwide, this is the /who all command. Listed below are a few examples of the <c "#B4B4B4">/who</c> command in action.<br>
<br>
<c "#B4B4B4">* /who all necromancer</c> - Lists all necromancers in the world.<br>
<br>
<c "#B4B4B4">* /who all 5</c> - Lists all the level 5 characters in the world.<br>
<br>
<c "#B4B4B4">* /who all cleric 3</c> - Lists all the level 3 clerics in the world.<br>
<br>
<c "#B4B4B4">* /who all Maddoc</c> - This returns any character whose name begins with "Maddoc". If no such person is online, it will return with a <c "#66CCFF">"There are no players in EverQuest who match those filters."</c><br>
<br>
<c "#66CCFF">** NOTE:</c> If there are too many matches to the query, it will cut the list short; you may need to refine the query a bit.<br>
